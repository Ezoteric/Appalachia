/**
 * Prunus Serotina (Black Cherry)
 * <p>
 * This tree was designed by Monsterfish and released as part of the 'Conquered' project
 * on Planet Minecraft (http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/conquered_-tree-and-rocks-bo2schematics-for-terraformers/).
 * It was converted into Java from its original schematic using the 'Schematic To Java Converter [For Modders]' program
 * by ThisIsMika (http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/2193206-schematic-to-java-converter-for-modders).
 * It has been modified slightly by WhichOnesPink to allow for random variation when generating in the world.
